# Circuit Sword Software
Power management and safe shutdown software for the Circuit Sword.

# Things to do
- Create a new DKMS for the Wi-Fi
- Create a new DKMS for the audio, because this driver also fails after the update procedure
- Remove the need of using downloaded packages (so that you always use the latest packages, while building the IMG)
- Release a version with the updated kernel 6.6. with the new DKMS drivers so that the functionality survives after a kernel update
